# rep-counter

	I'm into fitness and always carry around a notebook to the gym. Ahead of each workout, I'd always have to manually set my goals for each exercise based on how I did on all my exercises for my last workout. This would include setting my set and rep goals for a given weight, with a space for notes to remind myself after each exercise how I did or what went wrong. Although this method is extremely customized to my own needs, I find it time consuming and a waste of paper.

	I decided to create an app called RepCounter using React and Node to do this job for me since I know I'll always have my phone with me at the gym. RepCounter can then display previous lifting data and allow me to input new data for the current workout, all within the same single view.
