# RepCounter

I'm passionate about fitness and wanted to learn how to create a web app purely in JavaScript. I decided to start a project to help me learn how to create a modern fullstack application to solve a current problem I'm facing.

As a background, I currently bring a notebook to the gym with me for every workout. Prior to my workout, I manually set my goals for each exercise based on how I did on all my exercises for my last workout. This includes setting my set and rep goals for a given weight, with a space for notes to remind myself after each exercise how I did or what went wrong. Although this method is extremely customized to my own needs, I find it time consuming and a waste of paper.

I decided to create an app called RepCounter using React and Node to do this job for me since I know I'll have my phone accessible at the gym. I can then load up RepCounter to display previous lifting data and allow me to input new data for my current workout, all within the same view.
